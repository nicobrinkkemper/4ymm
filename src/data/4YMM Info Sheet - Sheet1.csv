","Four Wings, also known as Tetrapteryx or Jon, is an American science writer. In the original Super Mario Maker he was known for making large, intricate puzzle levels. He hasn't had the time and motivation to be as active in SMM2, but he likes this community too much to stop making levels entirely. He also sometimes writes poetry about science topics, or to accompany his SMM levels.",8NS-PTQ-QWF,8,Puzzle,US,9BS-KK5-DRF

More recently, after having found the Mario Maker community on Twitch and with some criticism and guidance, the quality of his levels has improved substantially.
