                        <p>4YMM is the fourth annual celebration of Mario Maker, a community project coordinated by Kiavik. Considered by many the definitive recurring Mario Maker collaboration, it has always featured contributions from some of the most celebrated makers from the Mario Maker community, as well as lesser known hot shots who qualified through an audition process. Whatâ€™s new this year is obviously that we have all the tools of Super Mario Maker 2 at our disposal.</p>
