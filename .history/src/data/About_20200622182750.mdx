# About 4YMM

> ## What is 4YMM
  4YMM is the fourth annual celebration of Mario Maker, a community project coordinated by Kiavik. Considered by many the definitive recurring Mario Maker collaboration, it has always featured contributions from some of the most celebrated makers from the Mario Maker community, as well as lesser known hot shots who qualified through an audition process. What’s new this year is obviously that we have all the tools of Super Mario Maker 2 at our disposal.

> ## Why is this not 1YMM2?
  Well, One Year of Mario Maker 2 is not a very slick name. While it’s been more than four years since the release of the first Super Mario Maker, it was decided the best course of action would be to continue the traditional naming convention. And hey, it hasn’t been five years yet!

> ## Is this a world?
  While collaborative world projects benefit from a cohesive design and a certain predictability in level progression, the YMM projects’ strength have always been their sprawling approach to level design. Each level is cohesive onto itself, but what you’ll find is that each creator has pursued and cultivated their own limit pushing mechanics. So you’ll never know what’s next.

> ## Is this kaizo?
  This is not kaizo, regardless of your definition of the word. What you’ll find is levels based around established gameplay principles, without item abuse, highly technical maneuvers or other kaizo staples. That is not to say the levels aren’t challenging, many of them will end up in expert or super expert rotation.
